Decision making app 2
-first version was simply a function with a switch with 10 possible questions

- Now there are specific key words that i'm slicing from the user input question variable and also using lowerCase to get rid of uppercase. If it's for example "should i" a switch will run with math.Random value for five cases with a bit more accuracy.
  -else statement contains original apps questions
